       * 
       *All Readable stream implementations must provide an implementation of the readable._read() method to fetch data from the underlying resource.
  
      When readable._read() is called, if data is available from the resource, the implementation should begin pushing that data into the read queue using the this.push(data chunk) method. _read() should continue reading from the resource and pushing data until readable.push() returns false. Only when _read() is called again after it has stopped should it resume pushing additional data onto the queue.
      
      Once the readable._read() method has been called, it will not be called again until more data is pushed through the readable.push() method. Empty data such as empty buffers and strings will not cause readable._read() to be called.
  
      The size argument is advisory. For implementations where a "read" is a single operation, returns data can use the size argument to determine how much data to fetch. Other implementations may ignore this argument and simply provide data whenever it becomes available. There is no need to "wait" until size bytes are available before calling stream.push(chunk).
  
      The readable._read() method is prefixed with an underscore because it is internal to the class that defines it, and should never be called directly by user programs.

      When the Readable is operating in flowing mode, the data added with readable.push() will be delivered by emitting a 'data' event.
  
      The readable.push() method is designed to be as flexible as possible. For example, when wrapping a lower-level source that provides some form of pause/resume mechanism, and a data callback, the low-level source can be wrapped by the custom Readable instance:
